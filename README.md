I've always had a passion for technology, in general. Growing up through the 90's digital age, I taught myself toubleshooting techniques on the home computer, which were really fun to solve. Tehnchology is always advancing and I would like to have some part in this movement. Recently, I've been exposed to the world of software development. I'm eager to learn all that I can through Promineo Tech.
