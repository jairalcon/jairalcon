# Hello, there.

- I've always had a general passion for technology for as long as I can remember.
- Growing up through the 90's digital age, I taught myself intermediate software and hardware toubleshooting techniques on the home computer, which were really fun to solve.
- Tehnchology is constantly advancing and I would like to partake in this movement.
- Recently, I've been exposed to the world of software development and all the opportunities associated with it.
- I'm eager to learn all that I can through Promineo Tech and to continue learning my new role as a software developer.

Here's a quote I stole from someone in my Promineo Tech cohort:

> Someone who asks a question is a fool for a minute, but someone who doesn't ask is a fool for a lifetime.

This has resonated with me because for the previous four years, as a supervisor, I had been the person with all the answers but
now I have all the questions.
